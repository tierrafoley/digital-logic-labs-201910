# Assignment for Lab 02 Transistor Logic Gates

This the assignment for lab 02, you will be graded based on the completion of this document.

## Demonstrations (4 pts)

Demonstrate the implementation of t he following gates to the instructor in class:
- Invertor ("Not Gate") (1 pt)
- Two pushbutton gate (Or Gate) (1 pt)
- Nor Gate (1 pt)
- Final Gate (see below) (1 pt)

## Final Gate (2 pts)

Keep your Nor gate. Build two more inverters, and connect one to each input (between the switch and 
the transistor of the Nor gate). Answer the following quuestion

- Show the circuit to your instructor
- Complete the logic table for this gate (1 pt)

 A | B | result
:-:|:-:|:-----:
 0 | 0 | 0
 0 | 1 | 0
 1 | 0 | 0
 1 | 1 | 1

- What logic does it implement? (1 pt)

## Explain how NOR Gate works with pictures of different current flow scenarios. (2 pts)

## Explain how Final Gate works with pictures of different current flow scenarios. (2 pts)
